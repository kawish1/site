## Chapter 1 Lecture 7: Introduction to Complex Numbers
<p class="lead"> You have learnt that natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and
irrational numbers are all real numbers. Are there numbers that are not <code> Real Numbers </code>?. 
Yes, There are!. They are called <code> Complex Numbers</code> which are

<code> Imaginary Part</code> of a <code> Complex Number</code>, and properties of <code> iota</code> which
