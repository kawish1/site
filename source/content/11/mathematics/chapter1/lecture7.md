## Chapter 1 Lecture 7: Introduction to Complex Numbers
<hr>
<p class="lead">
We have learnt that natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and
irrational numbers are all real numbers. Are there numbers that are not <code> Real Numbers?</code>
Yes, There are!. They are called <code> Complex Numbers</code> which are
<code> Ordered Pairs of Real Numbers</code>. In this lecture we will learn about <code> Real Part</code> and
<code> Imaginary Part</code> of a <code> Complex Number</code>, and properties of <code> iota</code> which
is <code>a square root of -1</code>.
