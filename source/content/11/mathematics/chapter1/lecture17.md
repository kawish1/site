## Chapter 1 Lecture 17: The Complex Plane
<p class="lead">
Complex numbers can be represented by ordered pair of real numbers. We know that ordered pairs
of real numbers can be represented in a coordinate plane. Therefore complex numbers can also be
represented in a plane called <code> The Complex Plane</code>. You will learn about the <code> Argand Diagram</code> and the <code> Z-Plane</code>. You will also learn about <code> Modulus</code> of a complex number.
